Code Architecture:
- I chose MVC pattern as I feel it would be neater to classify and build by the 3 parts

Further Improvements:
- Due to the lack of time, I wasn't able to implement various functions but have chosen to implement the most basic and required function which is to be able to get the exchange rate of the selected currency
- Future enhancements could include:
	- History of selected currencies for user to determine if it's a good rate to exchange currency
	- Being able to search for currencies instead of scrolling through a dropdown
	- Defaulting the currency based on locale
	- Listing of all currencies so that the user is able to compare

Feedbacks on Assignment:
- Originally, I thought there wasn't much to currency convertor, but as I build it, I realised there were multiple ways to build in and multiple functions that could be built. However, I had to prioritise on what would be the most required of a currency convertor.
